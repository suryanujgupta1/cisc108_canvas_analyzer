The Grade Trend plot shows how a students' grade evolves over the
semester. The first half of the graph shows progress so far in the
course, while the second half shows what could happen with any
ungraded assignments. The top-most line ("Maximum") shows the
maximum points that were possible over the entire semester,
ignoring the student's actual score. The two other lines represent
the student's "Highest" and "Lowest" possible scores. These two
lines are the same until the point in the semester where there
are ungraded assignments, at which point they fork into two paths.
The top path assumes the student receives a perfect on every
remaining assignment, and the bottom path assumes they get a
zero on the remaining assignments.

Although this may seem complicated, it is straightforward as
long as you translate each step carefully.

# Formula
Here are some shorthand formula to break down exactly how the
three plots are calculated:

```
(max_points of a submission) = 100 * (points_possible of submission) * (group_weight of submission)
total_max = sum(max_points/100)

(low_score of a submission) = 0 if submission is not graded,
                              otherwise (score of submission)
(low_points of a submission) = 100 * (low_score of submission) * (group_weight of submission)

(high_score of a submission) = (points_possible of submission) if submission is not graded, 
                               otherwise (score of submission)
(high_points of a submission) = 100 * (high_score of submission) * (group_weight of submission)

Calculate the running sum of low_points as a series
Calculate the running sum of high_points as a series
Calculate the running sum of max_points as a series

Divide each element of the running sums by the total_max

Plot each running sum series
```

# Example
These formula are tricky, so let's look at an example for a course
with 4 potential submissions (2 of which have been graded, and
2 of which have not been graded):

```
    score	workflow_state	points_possible	group_weight
1	5	"graded"	10	20
2	2	"graded"	2	40
3	None	"submitted"	5	20
4	None	"submitted"	6	40
```

We'll be iterating through these 4 submissions (and their associated
assignment and group) and need to do several rounds of calculation.


First, we'll calculate the max_points, low_points, and high_points
for each independent submission:

```
    max_points	low_points	high_points
1	100*10*20=20,000	100*5*20=10,000	100*5*20=10,000
2	100*2*40=8,000	100*2*40=8,000	100*2*40=8,000
3	100*5*20=10,000	100*0*20=0	100*5*20=10,000
4	100*6*40=24,000	100*0*40=0	100*6*40=24,000
```

Notice that for graded assignments, the low_points and high_points
are the same; for ungraded assignments, the max_points and high_points
are the same (and low_points are zero).

Second, we'll calculate the maximum score by adding up all the
max_points and dividing by 100:

```
max_points = (20,000 + 8,000 + 10,000 + 24,000)/100 = 620
```

Third, we'll calculate the running the sums:

```
    running_max  running_low  running_high

1   0+20,000=20,000         0+10,000=10,000     0+10,000=10,000
2	20,000+8,000=28,000	    10,000+8,000=18,000	10,000+8,000=18,000
3	28,000+10,000=38,000	18,000+0=18,000	    18,000+10,000=28,000
4	38,000+24,000=62,000	18,000+0=18,000	    28,000+24,000=52,000
```

Fourth, we'll divide each element of the running sums by the max_points, to get our final values:

```
    maxes	lows	highs
1	20,000/620=32.3	10,000/620=16.1	10,000/620=16.1
2	28,000/620=45.2	18,000/620=29.0	18,000/620=29.0
3	38,000/620=61.3	18,000/620=29.0	28,000/620=45.2
4	62,000/620=100	18,000/620=29.0	52,000/620=83.9
```
Finally, the values above are the ones we end up plotting.

There were many ways to arrange these calculations. However, you can't do this in one loop: you will need to do multiple rounds of iteration when all is said and done.

# General Running Sum Pattern

```python
# Initialize
running_sum = 0
running_sums = []
# Iterate
for item in a_list:
    # Update
    running_sum = running_sum + item
    running_sums.append(running_sum)
```
